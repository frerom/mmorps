Massive Multiplayer Online Rock Paper Scissors


## Use Case

- Alice enters the website start page.
- Alice chooses to create a 3 player game.
- Alice gets three links, one which she will use herself, and two others which she will send to Bob and Charlie.
- Alice opens one of these links and picks either Rock, Paper or Scissors.
- If Alice uses the link again a screen will show telling her it's waiting for the other players.
- After Bob and Charlie have made their choice (using their links), all three links will now display which player was the winner!
- If Alice and Bob both beat Charlie, then it's a tie.
- Then Charlie's link shows that he lost (lol)
- Alice and Bob gets to play another turn.
- Eventually the same link shows who won the game!
